    /*
     * An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.
     * When an error occurs within a method, the method creates an object and hands it off to the runtime system.
     *
     * Unchecked exceptions − An unchecked exception is an exception that occurs at the time of execution.
     * These are also called as Runtime-Exceptions. These include programming bugs, such as logic errors or improper use of an API.
     * Runtime exceptions are ignored at the time of compilation.
     *
     * Checked exceptions − A checked exception is an exception that is checked (notified) by the compiler at compilation-time,
     * these are also called as Compile time-Exceptions. These exceptions cannot simply be ignored, the programmer should take care of (handle) these exceptions.
     *  https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_exceptions.htm
     *
     *  The Runtime Exception is the parent class in all 'Exceptions' of the Java programming language that are expected to crash or break down the program or application when they occur.
     *  Unlike exceptions that are not considered as Runtime Exceptions, Runtime Exceptions are never checked.
