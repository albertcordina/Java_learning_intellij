/*
 * The ReentrantLock in Java is used for managing critical sections of code where multiple threads might contend for access. 
 * It provides a more flexible and powerful alternative to the traditional synchronized keyword for controlling access to shared resources. 
 * The term "reentrant" means that a thread can acquire the lock multiple times without deadlocking itself.
 * 
 * In this example:

1. SharedCounter has a shared variable count and a ReentrantLock named lock.
2. The incrementCounter method represents a critical section where the lock is acquired before incrementing the shared counter and released afterward.
3. Two threads (incrementThread1 and incrementThread2) are created to increment the counter concurrently.
4. The join method is used to wait for both threads to finish before printing the final counter value.

Using ReentrantLock in this scenario ensures that only one thread can be inside the critical 
section at a time, preventing race conditions and ensuring the integrity of the shared counter.

Here's a simple example where ReentrantLock is used to protect a shared counter:
